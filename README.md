# Check node and npm versions
node -v # v16.14
npm -v  # v8.19

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/khuzama98/Web3Distrupt-Workshop

# Install development dependencies
npm install
```

### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set all necessary environment
variables. Follow the example in `.env.example`.

If you don't already have a mnemonic, use this [bip39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to
generate one.

If you don't already have an infura key, use this [infura](https://infura.io/) to generate one.

### Commands

Try running some of the following tasks:

```sh
# Get help screen
npx hardhat help

# Run to compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run to generate typechain types
npx hardhat typechain

# Run hardhat tests
npx hardhat test

# Run hardhat tests with gas report
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test

# Run a local hardhat network
npx hardhat node

# Run script to deploy contracts locally
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts

# Run script to deploy contracts to a network specified in `hardhat.config.ts`
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network goerli

# Run script to verify contract to the network they are deployed to
# - Make sure to update the script with valid addresses and args
# - Make sure to set api keys of explorer in `.env` file, checkout `.env.example` for example
